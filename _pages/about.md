Hi! I'm **Rafael Elberg**, a Master's and Computer Engineering student at Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile. My research interests span **deep learning**, **cultural evolution**, **machine learning theory**, and **compositionality**.

I'm currently exploring generative models for long-tailed datasets, compositional representations, and how learning dynamics affect emergent language in artificial systems.
